DevOps Engineer with a Software Engineering background with 9 years of industry experience. Originally from Lebanon but currently plying my trade in Germany. Currently I am diving into new technologies while also dabbling a bit with some infosec.

Outside my work you can find me either trying to build healthier habits, working on my cooking skills, or exploring the country.
