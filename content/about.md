Although having more than half a decade experience in Software Engineering, I have always been intrigued by the world of DevOps engineering, and I got to officially make the shift from Software Engineering to DevOps on November 2nd, 2020. Recently, I am just diving into new technologies and dabbling a bit with infosec stuff.

Besides my work, I spend most of days trying to build better habits, work on my cooking skills, and sometimes videogaming.
