Last year, I made the move from Jekyll to Hugo for my blog.

At first, I was really excited about working on my blog and writing more and more on it. However, as the days gone by, I just didn’t seem to find the time or energy to keep writing. Sometimes I would start with a post or some knowledge note that I think would be useful, but I end up not finishing the note, and it just sits there in my notes without being revisited ever again. 

While I might not be able to revisit this blog right now, I am hoping that in the future I will be able to find the energy and time to post again. It’s always been a dream of mine to have a blog where I can share my thoughts and my knowledge with people who want to read my thoughts.

One of my thoughts would be to rewrite the whole website, with a new theme and another engine, but that will be for another time.
