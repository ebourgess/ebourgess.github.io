For as long as I remember, I always wanted to have a blog for me where I would be sharing my thoughts, knowledge, and discoverings with the world. And although setting up a blog is easy, it's filling it up that is hard. And although I write almost everyday, I rarely end up posting anything on the blog, meaning that there will always be a gap between each post.

Reflecting upon this, I do believe that blogging is hard. I have a lot of thoughts throughout the day of ideas that I would be writing about and that would be interesting for me to read on a blog, but to this day, a lot of posts that I have in the pipeline for this blog are being left unfinished as I simply don't have the time.

Work takes up all of my time, and when I am not working, I would rather be spending time with my partner and away from technology.

That being said, I am not going to get this blog down, but it might be a while before I get to post anything on here again.
